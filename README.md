  ## Usage

  This application uses the package express-session to authenticate a user and give them access for creating blog posts and commenting on others' posts. It also uses the express-handlesbar package so that Handlebars.js can used as the templating language. The bcrypt package is used to hash a user's password for security and peace of mind. MySQL2 and Sequelize are utilized so that a MySQL database can be used to store the created users info.
